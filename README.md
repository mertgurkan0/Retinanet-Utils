# Retinanet Utilities

This repository contains Python utility scripts used for data/image preprocessing for the project I contributed. Some of the utilities posted here were not available directly, so notebooks here can be helpful (mostly for pre-processing & annotation arranging) for [RetinaNet](https://github.com/fizyr/keras-retinanet).


## TO-DO
> 1. Currently commited with initial formats of ipynb files. I will add more guidelines to them.
> 2. Will add a documentation.
> 3. Preparing Python executables for these notebooks.
